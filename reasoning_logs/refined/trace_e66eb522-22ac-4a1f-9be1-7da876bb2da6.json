Instead, I will use another method to search for target genes involved in T cell exhaustion and TCR signaling.\n\nLet's utilize the PubMed database to retrieve relevant literature on this topic.\n\n<execute>\nfrom biomni.tool.literature import query_pubmed\n\n# Query PubMed for papers on genes involved in T cell exhaustion and TCR signaling\nresults = query_pubmed(\"genes involved in T cell exhaustion TCR signaling\")\nprint(results)\n</execute>\n\nIt seems there is an issue with accessing the necessary tools for performing literature searches.
